To me, this book is the be-all and end-all of defining, designing, and developing products.

Marty Cagan changed the way I looked at the art of product management. I have a newfound respect for my product colleagues because the job isn't easy!

My biggest takeaway from this book is how product, design, and engineering need alignment early in the process to help reduce risk.

Specifically, Marty points out four types of risks:

- value risk (whether customers will buy it or users will choose to use it)
- usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it)
- feasibility risk (whether engineers can build what is needed with teh time, skills, and tech available)
- business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business)

There's plenty tidbits about how the job of PM and Engineering can work together in unison.

This book is necessary for any software role, product, design, or engineering.
