### As a leader, it's important to set an example in various aspects of your role, but one that is often overlooked is the willingness to NOT be around.

### Being a leader means setting an example
Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, implemented a "no vacation policy" early in Netflix's tenure. Essentially, it puts the onus on the employee to take charge of their time off. The problem is, if there is no set amount of time off in place, much like what we see a lot in the tech world as "unlimited" or "flexible", people will tend to take time off that largely reflects what their boss and colleagues are taking for time off.

To combat that we must set the example, and that's making sure we not only take our own vacation but highly encourage our teams to do so.

**Go on vacation yourself!**

### Time off can allow you to think creatively
There have been studies showing that some big innovations happen after people come back from a vacation.

"Time off provides mental bandwidth that allows you to think creatively and see your work in a different light," Reed Hastings explained. "If you are working all the time, you don't have the perspective to see your problem with fresh eyes."

**Take time off to refresh your mind. Unplug from work. It's not healthy to always have your "On" switch up.**

### On a personal front...
This is my second time on parental leave. I'm fortunate to work for a company that offers a generous leave of 14 weeks for both parents.

Candidly, I was a bit nervous when my wife and I had our first child, knowing I would be away from my role for the most amount of time in my career at once. It sounds silly, but I had wacky thoughts going through my head:

- Will people just forget about me? Out of sight, out of mind!
- Will I miss something important that would warrant my attention?
- Will I lose my job?

At the time, the feelings were real. I couldn't have been more wrong.

If you're a leader, whether you manage people or not, if you've empowered others, coached others, taught those around you, and exemplified the power of ownership and accountability, it will all (for the most part) fall into place.

I work with talented and smart people&mdash;way smarter than I'll ever be. I fully trust that our team will continue to deliver and innovate for the business and our customer base, whether I am around or not.

At the end of the day, take your time off and have no regrets about it. Being with our two boys and experiencing being parents for the first 14 weeks of their lives is time well spent and time we will never forget. We know not everybody has it as good as us in terms of flexibility. For that, we're thankful and appreciative.

So if you do have the time, take it and enjoy it!
