### As a leader, it's essential to have the willingness to NOT be around.

### Being a leader means setting an example
Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, implemented a "no vacation policy" early in Netflix's tenure. The lack of a policy puts the onus on the employee to take charge of their time away from the office. The problem is, if there is no set amount of time off in place, much like what we see a lot in the tech world as "unlimited" or "flexible", people will tend to take time off that primarily reflects what their boss and colleagues are taking.

To combat that, we must set an example, which means making sure we take our own vacations and highly encourage our teams to do so.

**Go on vacation yourself!**

### Time off can allow you to think creatively
Studies have shown that some significant innovations happen after people return from a vacation.

"Time off provides mental bandwidth that allows you to think creatively and see your work in a different light," Reed Hastings explained. "If you are working all the time, you don't have the perspective to see your problem with fresh eyes."

**Get away from the office. Use days to refresh your mind. Unplug from work. It's not healthy to always have your "On" switch toggled.**

### On a personal front...
I'm on parental leave for the second time in my career. I'm fortunate to work for a company that offers generous leave to both parents.

Candidly, I was a bit nervous when my wife and I had our first child, knowing I would be away from my role for the most time in my career. I had wacky thoughts going through my head:

- Will people forget about me? Out of sight, out of mind!
- Will I miss something important that would warrant my attention?
- Who will take care of _[insert random task]_? (P.S. you should take care of this via a coverage document)

At the time, the feelings were real. I couldn't have been more wrong.

If you're a leader, whether you manage people or not, if you've empowered others, coached others, taught those around you, and exemplified the power of ownership and accountability, it will all (for the most part) fall into place.

I work with talented and intelligent people&mdash;way smarter than I'll ever be. Our team will continue to deliver and innovate for the business and our customer base, regardless of whether I'm around.

Take your time off and have no regrets about it. Being with our two boys and experiencing being parents for the first weeks of their lives is magical and a time we will never forget. We are grateful and appreciative of our employers and the flexibility they provide.
