*tl;dr: During a thought experiment about career guidance, I asked an AI assistant about encouraging my toddlers (currently 1 and 2) toward software engineering. While I'd never push my kids into any career they didn't choose for themselves, the AI's hesitation about traditional software engineering paths made me reflect on how dramatically our field is transforming. Here's what happened when an AI made me question assumptions about the future of tech careers â€“ even though my kids can barely operate an iPad.*

There I was, with almost twenty years of industry experience, confidently chatting with an AI assistant about steering my kids toward software engineering. My little ones are only 1 and 2 years old â€“ clearly, I'm getting an early start on the whole career planning thing. ðŸ˜‰ It was really just a thought experiment to test the AI's reasoning, but you know how parents can be â€“ always planning ahead to set our kids up for success.

Then something unexpected happened. The AI equivalent of raising an eyebrow and saying, "Hold up â€“ let's think about this."

It's not every day that artificial intelligence makes you question your parental guidance strategy. But there I was, being challenged by an AI to reconsider my assumption that software engineering â€“ at least as we know it today â€“ is the golden ticket to future success. The irony wasn't lost on me. Here was an AI system, built by software engineers, suggesting that traditional software engineering might not be the safest bet for tomorrow's workforce.

## Traditional Coding Could Be Yesterday's Game

Remember when knowing HTML and CSS made you the wizard of the internet? When being 'good with computers' meant you were everyone's on-call IT support for everything from printer jams to mysterious Outlook crashes? Those days feel about as current as dial-up modems. Today's rapid tech evolution makes the flip phones and BlackBerry's of the early 2000s look positively prehistoric. The AI painted a future where:

- Problem-solving and critical thinking will matter more than syntax knowledge â€“ it's about designing solutions that AI can't dream up on its own
- Basic coding tasks will increasingly be handled by autonomous agents, making adaptability and continuous learning essential survival skills
- System design and architecture skills will be key competitive advantages, requiring both deep technical knowledge and broad perspective
- Cross-disciplinary thinking and the ability to orchestrate AI systems will trump traditional programming skills
- Prompt engineering will become as fundamental as algorithm design â€“ crafting the perfect instructions for AI will be an art form in itself
- The ability to collaborate across teams and translate complex ideas into plain English will become as crucial as technical expertise

The message was clear: tomorrow's tech leaders won't just need to know how to code â€“ they'll need to know how to think, adapt, collaborate, and make responsible choices in an AI-first world.

What struck me most was the emphasis on meta-skills over technical specifics. Instead of pushing kids toward memorizing syntax and algorithms, we should be nurturing problem-solving mindsets, adaptability and learning agility, creative thinking and innovation, understanding human needs and behaviors, and business acumen with strategic thinking. It's less about teaching them to play specific notes and more about helping them understand music theory â€“ giving them the foundation to compose whatever the future requires.

As parents in tech, we often fall into a familiar trap. We see any success and stability we've found in our careers and naturally want to create a similar path for our children. It's like trying to build them a bridge to cross a river that might not even be there when they reach it. The AI's perspective reminded me that our role isn't to carve a path in stone, but to help our children develop the tools to forge their own paths. Maybe instead of saying "learn to code," we should be saying "learn to learn" and "learn to create."

So what's the takeaway? Should we abandon the idea of introducing our kids to programming? Absolutely not. But perhaps we need to reframe how we think about it. Use coding as a tool to develop logical thinking, not as an end goal. Encourage exploration of technology's role in solving real problems. Focus on understanding systems and connections rather than just implementation. Nurture creativity and innovation alongside technical skills.

## The Plot Twist Ending

Here's the beautiful irony: by letting go of our rigid vision of "software engineer" as a career path, we might actually better prepare our children for the future of technology. It's like training for a marathon by becoming a better all-around athlete, rather than just practicing running. The AI's hesitation about pushing kids toward traditional software engineering wasn't about dismissing the field â€“ it was about embracing its evolution. And maybe that's the most important lesson: in a world where AI can challenge our assumptions about technology careers, the best gift we can give our children is the ability to adapt, create, and thrive in whatever future emerges.

As I wrapped up my conversation with the AI, I couldn't help but appreciate the metaphorical mic drop moment. I was sitting here getting schooled about the future of tech by the very technology that's reshaping it. Sometimes the best parenting insights come from the most unexpected sources â€“ even if that source is a bunch of ones and zeros challenging your assumptions about the future.
